# DeathBan-Plugin
Version 2.0 of Death-Ban.

#DeathBan
*for Moonmoon's HardCore Server.


This plugin adds a player to the banlist when they die, and leave.
A normal survival player will have their gamemode updated to spectator upon death in Hardcore minecraft, and this plugin bans all spectators who leave the game.
